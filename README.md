Text Classification using SVM
Overview:
This project implements Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying text data into predefined categories. It uses TF-IDF for feature extraction and compares SVM performance with Random Forest.

Problem:
Text data is high-dimensional and unstructured, making accurate classification challenging with traditional methods.

Objective:
To build an optimized SVM-based text classification model that performs well on unseen data.

Methodology:
Text feature extraction using TF-IDF
Model training using Linear and RBF SVM
Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search
Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Performance comparison with Random Forest

Technologies:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Dataset:
Data.csv containing text and corresponding labels.

Conclusion:
SVM effectively handles high-dimensional text data and delivers strong classification performance.
